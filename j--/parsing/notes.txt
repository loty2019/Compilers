1. For each problem, provide in more than 100 words, a short, high-level description of the problem;
your approach to solve it; and any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve them.

Problem 1 (Operators):
So...I had to update some parsing methods to recognize the operators and map them to the AST nodes. This was
pretty straightforward! Just modified the right spots in the parser so it can handle these new operators.
No major issues, just needed to follow the patterns already in place.

Problem 2 (Long and Double Basic Types):
For this one, I had to add support for long and double. I tweaked methods basicType(), seeBasicType(), seeReferenceType() and literal() to recognize and parse
long and double. The only tricky part was ensuring the parser distinguishes these from other basic types like int but it wasn't too bad
once I got the hang of it.

Problem 3 (For Statement):
Adding support for for loops (LOL) involved changing the parser to handle the initialization, condition and update parts of the loop. I added methods forInit()
forUpdate(). What was challenging was making sure both variable declarations and expressions are worked correctly because on problem 4 I then found out they were not.

Problem 4 (Break Statement):
This was supposed to be simple, just adding support for the break statement, but turned out to take longer then it should. even tho gradescore said problem 3 was correct, it was not.
I had to go back and fix the for loop to make sure it was working correctly. Once I did that, adding the break statement was easy.

Problem 5 (Continue Statement):
Same as problem 4 as they are very similar. I did them at the same time.

Problem 6 (Switch Statement):
I had to add methods to parse the switch block using switchBlockStatementGroup() and switchLabel(). The hard part was handling the flow inside the switch block and making sure the
parser didn't miss anything, it took a little more time than I wished.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, course staff, other), and
the nature of help received.

n/a                    n/a              n/a

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from
doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.

More test cases for problem 3 on gradescope. I had to go back and fix problem 3 even tho it said it was correct, only was to find out was from problem 4.
