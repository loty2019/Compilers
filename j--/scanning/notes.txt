1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical jargon) of each problem
in no more than 100 words.

Problem 1 (Multiline Comment):
Straightfoward exercice, just had to moify the scanner where we check the ch and if we find
the pattern that rappresnts the beginning of a single line or multiline then anything after
that shoud be ignored until the patttern is seen again

Problem 2 (Reserved Words):
this was long but esentially we had to match the token Info with image and then rseserve the
keyword in the scanner

Problem 3 (Operators):
this was very similar to the prevous one expect that i needed a litle bit more logic to be
implemented in the scanner

Problem 4 (Literals):
this was fun, i got stuck trying to solve the double that starte with a . bit then i relized
that the . was alread a case so all i had was add more logic to that case not implement a whole
new one. for the other scannign parenters the logic was kinda the same, read the integers if there
are any and if you find a character append that to the buffer and then check for more integers,
return accordingly.
